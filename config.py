## within my text editor (atom) i start this file as named config; this can be changed to better fit the syntax of PRAW

#previous config.py file

username="your_username"
password="your_p/w"
client_id="your_client_id"
client_secret="your_secret_key"

# after using your cmd line to move the config.py file to a praw.ini file, edit it to look as below

[dannyphantombot]
# after you convert it to a praw.ini and you include the name in brackets you'll move over to your bots code which you'll see visualized
username: dannyisabott
password: "your p/w"
client_id: "your_client_id"
client_secret: "your_secret_key"
  
# for example:

# you have a second bot account

# [secondbotaccount]
# username: secondbotaccount
# password: "your p/w"
# client_id: "your_client_id"
# client_secret: "your_secret_key"

# in the secondbotaccount.py file you input 'secondbotaccount' instead of 'dannyphantombot'
